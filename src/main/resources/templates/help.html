        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>This is an app created by Adam Cross mainly for practice learning Spring boot and related technologies.</p>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>
            You can store random bits of text data and easily tag them by subject using #hashtags.
            The query feature allows you to easily search all of your existing notes
            by hashtag.
        </p>
        <h3>
            So the entire purpose of this app is just to store and retrieve bits of text data?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes. It's worth noting how querying works though. If you query your notes for "#apple #pear" then
            it will return only the notes with both the #apple and the #pear hashtags.
        </p>
        <h3>I noticed an error when I did [X].</h3>
        <p>
            This is a one-man project made for practice. I will keep polishing it as a learning
            exercise, but I will probably never complete it to the standards of a production
            application.
        </p>
        <h3>I forgot my password.</h3>
        <p>
            Sorry. There is no recovery feature.
